This is a Django-based web application designed to catalog and track vintage and current NIN t-shirts.

Copy settings_local.template to settings_local.py and set the db settings and absolute paths as appropriate.
Changes to settings.py should be limited to generally applicable or global project updates.

Additionally, if running a standalone development environment without Apache integration, uncomment the
appropriate lines in urls.py.
